# TODO
* I can't read anything, the fonts are all small and gray

* Get a sponsor list
* Write headers for all the pages (News, Projects, History, Publications, People)
* Get everyone to write a project blurb
* Seed the news entries with something interesting
* Get a list of publications
* Get a list of people, and add sub-menu entries
