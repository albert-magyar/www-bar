# The RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture

RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is a new instruction set architecture (ISA)
that was originally designed to support computer architecture research and
education and is now set become a standard open architecture for industry
implementations under the governance of the RISC-V Foundation. RISC-V was
originally developed in the Computer Science Division of the EECS Department at
the University of California, Berkeley.
