The paper “Locality Exists in Graph Processing: Workload Characterization on an
Ivy Bridge Server”, co-authored by EECS graduate student Scott Beamer and
Profs. Krste Asanovic and David Patterson received the Best Paper Award at the
[2015 IEEE International Symposium on Workload
Characterization](http://www.iiswc.org/iiswc2015/index.html).

Abstract: Abstract—Graph processing is an increasingly important application
domain and is typically communication-bound. In this work, we analyze the
performance characteristics of three high performance graph algorithm codebases
using hardware performance counters on a conventional dual-socket server.
Unlike many other communication-bound workloads, graph algorithms struggle to
fully utilize the platform’s memory bandwidth and so increasing memory
bandwidth utilization could be just as effective as decreasing communication.
Based on our observations of simultaneous low compute and bandwidth
utilization, we find there is substantial room for a different processor
architecture to improve performance without requiring a new memory system.

Congratulations, Scott!
