------

Andrew is a Ph.D. candidate in the [ASPIRE
Lab](http://aspire.eecs.berkeley.edu) at Cal.  His research interests broadly
encompass the hardware-software interface and its implications for the
adjacent layers of the computing stack.  Alongside his fantastic colleagues,
[Yunsup](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yunsup/),
[Krste](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/), and
[Dave](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/), he designed
[RISC-V](http://riscv.org/), a free and open instruction set architecture.
Andrew's goal is to make RISC-V the standard ISA for research, education, and
industrial implementation.

Andrew received his M.S. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2011.  In
2008, he graduated summa cum laude from the Pratt School of Engineering at
Duke University with a B.S.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
