------
RISC-V is a new free and open instruction set architecture (ISA) developed at
UC Berkeley, initially designed for research and education, but is now
increasingly being used for commercial designs.  A full set of software tools
for the architecture are also under development and are being prepared for open
distribution.  RISC-V was initially developed as part of (Par
Lab)[http://parlab.eecs.berkeley.edu] and is now part of
(ASPIRE)[http://aspire.eecs.berkeley.edu].
