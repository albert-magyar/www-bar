------
ASPIRE is a new 5-year research project that recognizes the shift from
transistor-scaling-driven performance improvements to a new post-scaling world
where whole-stack co-design is the key to improved efficiency. Building on the
success of the (Par Lab)[http://parlab.eecs.berkeley.edu] project,
it uses deep hardware and software co-tuning to achieve the highest possible
performance and energy efficiency for future warehouse-scale and mobile
computing systems.
